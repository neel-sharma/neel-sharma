### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
**neel-sharma/neel-sharma** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

From writing .bat 'viruses' behind school notebooks to engineering my 
objective for learning computer languages was to automate every 
repetitive activity that we do again and again daily. 
After spending almost an year on a new language named 'flutter' with a blurry 
documentation all I've known about programming is that after 
learning 'C' language learning any other language 
is just about having the curiosity to learn. The curiosity to go through every 
stack overflow reply on a coding problem till the job is done.
