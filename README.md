### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
**neel-sharma/neel-sharma** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.
From writing .bat 'viruses' behind school notebooks to engineering my 
objective for learning computer languages was to automate every 
repetitive activity that we do again and again daily. 

More about me: https://neelsharma.dev-->

I've successfully delivered over 30 projects for startups, freelance clients, and both product and service-based companies.

Additionally, my strong understanding of Flutter's evolution allows me to adapt quickly to new updates and best practices. I have extensive experience in technical interviewing, having conducted over 100 interviews for developer, senior developer, and mobile lead positions.
