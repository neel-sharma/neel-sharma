### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
**neel-sharma/neel-sharma** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.
From writing .bat 'viruses' behind school notebooks to engineering my 
objective for learning computer languages was to automate every 
repetitive activity that we do again and again daily.
